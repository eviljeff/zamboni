Dear add-on author,

While testing add-ons for compatibility with the upcoming release of {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}, we detected some potential compatibility issues with your add-on {{ADDON_NAME}}. You can view these issues here: {{RESULT_LINKS}}

Because of these potential problems, we were not able to automatically mark your add-on as compatible with {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}. Please look into these issues and upload a new version if necessary. If you've tested your add-on and no changes are required, you can update your compatibility to {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} here: {{COMPAT_LINK}}

For more information on our new compatibility process with rapid {{APPLICATION}} releases, please read this post: http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2011/04/19/add-on-compatibility-rapid-releases/

Thank you,
Firefox Add-ons team
