Dear add-on author,

Good news! Our automated tests did not detect any compatibility issues with your add-on {{ADDON_NAME}} and {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}. We've updated your add-on's compatibility to work with {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} so that our Aurora users can begin using your add-on.

We encourage you to view the results of the compatibility test, as some compatibility issues may have been detected but without enough certainty to declare the add-on incompatible: {{RESULT_LINKS}}

This compatibility bump is server-side and we did not modify your add-on package in any way.

For more information on our new compatibility process with rapid {{APPLICATION}} releases, please read this post: http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2011/04/19/add-on-compatibility-rapid-releases/

Thank you,
Firefox Add-ons team
