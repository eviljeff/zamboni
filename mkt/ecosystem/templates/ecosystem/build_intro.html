          Open Web Apps are a great opportunity for those who need to
          develop applications that work on the largest number of
          devices, and for those who cannot afford to develop an app for
          every vendor platform (such as Android, iOS, and
          &quot;classical&quot; desktop web browsers). The difference
          between an app and a website is that you can install an app and
          more thoroughly integrate it into your device. It’s not a bookmark
          &mdash; it’s part of a system. Open Web Apps hold that great
          promise. They are an opportunity that we should not miss,
          otherwise the Web might become fragmented once more.

          With this in mind it should be clear that Open Web Apps (OWA in
          short) are intended to be standardized and to become part of
          &quot;the Web&quot;. If successful, OWA should eventually work on
          all browsers, operating systems and devices.

          At Mozilla we are working hard to create this apps platform that
          is backed entirely by the open Web. It’s not intended to be a
          &quot;Mozilla platform&quot; or a &quot;Firefox platform&quot;.
          <strong>The Web is the platform</strong>. We’re creating a set of
          open APIs and implementations to show how portable apps can exist
          on the Web without vendor lock-in. Other groups like Facebook and
          Google Chrome are also working on apps platforms backed by the
          Web. <a href="{{ url_canvas }}">Facebook apps</a> are meant to hook
          into Facebook and <a href="{{ url_chrome }}">Chrome apps</a> are
          designed for Chrome OS devices and Google servers. Chrome apps are
          the most similar to Open Web Apps. We continue to collaborate with
          the Google Chrome team as app standards evolve and we definitely
          share a lot of the same vision. There is tremendous potential for
          all Web based app platforms to converge and we invite all vendors
          to help us build the right Open Web App APIs.

          Even though currently you must have a Mozilla Firefox-based engine
          (&quot;Web runtime&quot;) to use Open Web Apps, it is not intended
          that this always will be the case. Many parts of the Open Web Apps
          project are still being worked out and it isn't possible to
          implement everything in all browsers at once. Although many parts
          of Open Web Apps are already standardized, many other parts are
          still in flux. It is intended and hoped that Open Web Apps will be
          a standard capability that is available in all major browsers.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Therefore, when you read the MDN pages that deal with Open Web
          Apps, please keep in mind that even though much of the information
          is specific to Firefox right now, it will hopefully enable you to
          develop Open Web Apps for all browsers in the future.
        {% endtrans -%}

      <h2>{{ _('Web standards') }}</h2>

          OWA technology is not a single piece, it is an umbrella that groups
          many different technologies and some of them are very young. At the
          moment, parts of OWA are standardized (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript,
          IndexedDB, etc.). Other parts are not yet standardized and the
          Mozilla implementation is thus specific to Firefox or to some other
          Mozilla technology. As the Mozilla mission is to share and to
          empower everyone, this situation is only temporary. That's why in
          the OWA docs we will try to clearly identify the parts of OWA that
          are not yet standardized.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Please also note that there may be some OWA-related proposals and
          potential standards that are not used by Mozilla.

          From the ground up Mozilla has been building an apps system that
          lets users buy an app once and run it on all of their HTML5
          devices. Very soon Mozilla will <a href="{{ url_nytimes }}">launch
          the first Firefox OS phone</a> but that will be just one device on
          which to run your apps. When you purchase an app through the
          <a href="{{ url_mkt }}">Firefox Marketplace</a>, the system
          installs a receipt on your device. The
          <a href="{{ url_receipt }}">receipt</a> is a JSON Web Token with
          metadata that links to the Marketplace’s public key and its
          verification service URL. When an app starts up it can verify the
          receipt but the receipt on the device <em>is not tied</em> to the
          Firefox Marketplace. The receipt is just a cryptographically
          verifiable proof of purchase. Anyone can sell open Web apps if they
          follow the receipt specs. <strong>When you buy an app, it is
          intended to be portable across any device that supports the Open
          Web Apps system.</strong>

          Mozilla is building the infrastructure needed to run Open Web Apps
          on any HTML5 device. <a href="{{ url_features }}">Firefox for
          Android</a> will let you install and run apps (you can try it
          today on the <a href="{{ url_nightly }}">nightly</a> build).
          Installed app icons go to your home screen just like regular
          Android apps. You can also install and run Web apps on your
          Windows, Mac, or Linux desktop using Firefox (this currently works
          in the <a href="{{ url_nightly }}">nightly</a> build). Currently
          some version of Firefox is required, but it is intended that the
          Open Web Apps system will eventually be supported by all major
          browsers as a set of standards. From day one Mozilla has included
          all major HTML5 compliant browsers in its proof of concepts; you
          can take a look at this hosted JavaScript
          <a href="{{ url_shim }}">shim</a> for ideas on how to support the
          apps platform on a non-Firefox browser.

          In the future the Open Web Apps system will support
          <a href="{{ url_aitc }}">syncing your installed apps</a> across
          devices. Since receipts are portable you could just sync them
          yourself if you wanted to. In case it’s not obvious, you can always
          run a free open Web app in any browser because it is no different
          than a website. It might, however, use new
          <a href="{{ url_api }}">mobile specific web APIs</a> which are not

          Part of the success of mobile app platforms like iOS and Android is
          that they make it very easy to try out new business models through
          mobile payments. Those models are still evolving but commerce is no
          doubt something that, at the moment, is awkward on the desktop Web
          and more natural on mobile. Specifically, it’s very convenient to
          charge something to your phone bill when you’re already accessing
          it from your phone anyway. With the launch of Firefox OS, the apps
          ecosystem will support app purchases and in-app payments through
          the <a href="{{ url_payment }}">WebPayment API</a>. Supporting
          commerce is crucial for the growth of an apps platform.
          <strong>The use of the proposed payment API is completely
          <em>optional</em></strong>. Mozilla won’t prevent any app from
          using its own in-app payment system.
