          The ability to use apps when not connected to the Internet is
          especially important for mobile devices, which may wander out of
          coverage areas. Of course, reducing the amount of time your app
          waits for data from a server improves the responsiveness of your app.
          This makes your app <em>feel</em> fast and is one of the most
          important considerations when developing web apps with HTML5.

          There are a few technologies built into HTML (and available to
          Firefox OS) that you can use to ensure your app works offline. These
          technologies can be used to improve the responsiveness of your
          current web app. The key to a responsive app experience (similar to
          iOS and Android) is speed. Using Appcache and JavaScript storage will
          allow your app to be downloaded and cached until you update its
          assets. This means your users can now use your app offline.

          Typically, this will be a list of all the CSS, fonts, JavaScript, and
          image files you use. You can
          <a href="{{ generator_url }}" rel="external">use tools</a> to

          <dt><a href="{{ localstorage_url }}">localStorage</a></dt>
          <dd>
            Synchronous and easy-to-use, localStorage is available in modern
            browsers, but it's also the slowest. Try to avoid using it directly
            and use a library that includes it as a fallback instead.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="{{ indexeddb_url }}">IndexedDB</a></dt>
          <dd>
            IndexedDB is an asynchronous and fast library that can store any
            JavaScript type without having to serialize it first. It isn't
            available in IE or iOS as of writing but is available in Chrome
            and Firefox.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="{{ websql_url }}" rel="external">WebSQL</a></dt>
          <dd>
            WebSQL is asynchronous like IndexedDB, but is only needed for
            Safari/iOS compatibility. WebSQL is officially deprecated by the
            W3C but is still supported by many WebKit browsers.

          We recommend using
          <a href="{{ localforage_url }}" rel="external">localForage</a>,
          which combines a library from Firefox OS with fallbacks for other
          browsers. It allows you to store key/value pairs for use between
          page loads, but does so asynchronously whenever possible. This
          improves the responsiveness of your app.
        {% endtrans -%}

        <pre><code>
var asyncStorage = require('localForage').asyncStorage;

function displayValue() {
    asyncStorage.get('my_key', function(value) {
        alert('My value is: ' + value);
    });

      <h2>{{ _('On localStorage') }}</h2>

      <p>
        {%- trans localforage='https://github.com/tofumatt/localForage' %}
          localStorage is the most compatible API for saving data between page
          views in JavaScript, but it has a few major limitations. localStorage
          is synchronous, so using it blocks the main thread from running,
          causing your app to feel slow when getting or setting data. It also
          can't handle large amounts of data or JavaScript types like
          TypedArrays. You can use localStorage for small amounts of data you
          interact with rarely, but we recommend
          <a href="{{ localForage }}" rel="external">localForage's
          asyncStorage library</a>, which uses faster storage by default but
          falls back to localStorage if it's all that is available.

                  storage_url='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebAPI/Device_Storage' %}
          Use <a href="{{ storage_url }}">DeviceStorage</a> or
          <a href="{{ indexeddb_url }}">IndexedDB</a> to store large pieces
          of data. localStorage is unsuitable for large blob storage, but you
          can save chunks of data to IndexedDB. The Podcasts reference app does
          this in <a href="{{ podcasts_url }}" rel="external">its episode model
          code</a>.

      </p>

      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Keep in mind that storing large files (over 100MB) is still largely
          uncharted territory and you may encouter some issues.

          If you’re

          you don't need to use an Appcache manifest; all app assets are

      <h1>{{ _('Managing Offline State and HTTP Requests') }}</h1>

      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          There are a few APIs available to determine the user's connection
          status. These are useful because you can skip HTTP requests if you
          know the user is offline. You can also display less generic failure
          messages. For example: if you were writing a Twitter client, a
          message like “New tweets cannot be loaded while offline” is more
          informative than “Could not make HTTP connection.”
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>

      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          Try to focus on loading data from your/others' API only when needed,
          and keep data cached so you don't have to request the same data
          twice. It can also be helpful to prefetch some data so the user can
          use parts of your app offline that they have yet to open.
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>

      <h2 id="checking_connectivity">{{ _('Checking connectivity') }}</h2>

      <p>
        {%- trans %}
          A key factor in working well offline is to check whether the device
          has connectivity and to respond appropriately when it doesn't. A
          message to the user that the app won't work offline is better than
          getting stuck or getting a generic timeout error.
        {% endtrans -%}

        {# L10n: Do not localize text in <code></code> #}
        {%- trans url='//developer.mozilla.org/docs/DOM/window.navigator.onLine' %}
          The simplest way to do this is to check and listen for changes to
          the <a href="{{ url }}"><code>window.navigator.onLine</code></a>
          property. Note that this value can sometimes return false positives.

          If you are using <a href="{{ xhr_url }}">XMLHttpRequest</a> to update
          data dynamically, you can check its response to determine if the
          network connection has dropped during the use of your app. If your
          app has <a href="{{ systemxhr_url }}">systemXHR privileges</a>, you
          can check for a connection to a site unlikely to be down to
          determine if you have an active connection (iOS does this with
          Apple.com).
